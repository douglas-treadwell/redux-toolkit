# `isAnyOf`

A higher-order function that accepts several type guard functions or `redux-toolkit` action creator functions and
returns a type guard function that matches (returns true) if *any* of the provided functions match.  Action creator
functions include the ones produced by `createAction` or the child actions of an async thunk produced by
`createAsyncThunk`, such as `asyncThunk.pending`, `asyncThunk.fulfilled`, and `asyncThunk.rejected`.

```js
function isAnyOf(...matchers)
```

## Reducing code duplication and boilerplate

When using the `builder` pattern to construct a reducer, we add cases or matchers one at a time.  However,
sometimes we can use the same reducer for several cases.  The following is a trivial example.

```ts
import { createAsyncThunk, createReducer } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

interface LoadingState {
  isLoading: boolean;
}

const initialState: LoadingState = { isLoading: false }

const request = createAsyncThunk('request', () => {});

const loadingReducer = createReducer(initialState, builder => {
  builder
    .addCase(request.pending, (state, action) => ({
      isLoading: true
    }))
    .addCase(request.fulfilled, (state, action) => ({
      isLoading: false
    }))
    .addCase(request.rejected, (state, action) => ({
      isLoading: false
    }))
})
```

The `isAnyOf` helper enables us to easily use the same reducer for several cases.

```ts
import { createAsyncThunk, createReducer, isAnyOf } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

interface LoadingState {
  isLoading: boolean
}

const initialState: LoadingState = { isLoading: false }

const request = createAsyncThunk('request', () => {});

const requestFinished = isAnyOf(request.fulfilled, request.rejected);

const loadingReducer = createReducer(initialState, builder => {
  builder
    .addCase(request.pending, (state, action) => ({
      isLoading: true
    }))
    .addMatcher(requestFinished, (state, action) => ({
      isLoading: false
    }))
})
```

## As a TypeScript TypeGuard

The function `isAnyOf` also accepts regular TypeScript type guards, and the function returned
by `isAnyOf` can also be used as a TypeScript type guard in other contexts.

```ts
import { isAnyOf, PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

interface Data {
  isInteresting: boolean;
  isSpecial: boolean;
}

interface Special extends Data {
  isSpecial: true;
}

interface Interesting extends Data {
  isInteresting: true;
}

function isSpecial(action: PayloadAction<Data>): action is PayloadAction<Special> {
  return action.payload.isSpecial;
}

function isInteresting(action: PayloadAction<Data>): action is PayloadAction<Interesting> {
  return action.payload.isInteresting;
}

const isSpecialOrInteresting = isAnyOf(isSpecial, isInteresting);

function someFunction(action: PayloadAction<Data>) {
  if (isSpecialOrInteresting(action)) {
    // "action" will be correctly typed as:
    // `PayloadAction<Special> | PayloadAction<Interesting>`
  }
}
